 Project Description:
With the rise of online job platforms, fraudulent job postings have become a significant concern, leading to privacy breaches, financial scams, and loss of trust among job seekers. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically identify and classify fake job postings based on various features such as job title, company profile, description, requirements, and more.

By analyzing the textual content and metadata of job listings, we can train a classifier (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest) to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent job posts. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature extraction (like TF-IDF), and model training/evaluation.

This solution helps job platforms and users to detect potentially harmful listings, enhancing platform safety and protecting job seekers from scams.
