 Project Description:
With the rise of online job platforms, fraudulent job postings have become a significant concern, leading to privacy breaches, financial scams, and loss of trust among job seekers. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically identify and classify fake job postings based on various features such as job title, company profile, description, requirements, and more.

By analyzing the textual content and metadata of job listings, we can train a classifier (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest) to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent job posts. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature extraction (like TF-IDF), and model training/evaluation.

This solution helps job platforms and users to detect potentially harmful listings, enhancing platform safety and protecting job seekers from scams.

 Objectives:
Preprocess the job postings dataset by cleaning and transforming the text features.

Analyze and visualize the distribution of fake vs. real jobs.

Build machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) to classify job postings as fraudulent or legitimate.

Evaluate the performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools:
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK (for NLP tasks)

Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation
üîÑ Workflow:
Data Collection: Load the dataset.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Text cleaning (stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization)

Convert categorical to numerical data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions, correlations, and class imbalances

Feature Engineering:

Vectorize text data using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Model Building & Evaluation:

Train ML models

Evaluate using classification metrics

Deployment (Optional):

Create a simple web app using Flask or Streamlit to input job data and predict fraud status

‚úÖ Expected Outcome:
A machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent job postings.

Insights into which features are most indicative of fraud.

A prototype tool that job seekers or portal administrators can use for validation.
